Conclusion
==========

In conclusion, we performed the classification and implementation on the training and testing model of the artifact detection tool for blur detection. Currently, achieved results for our current best model which has ~94% accuracy on the training set and ~89% accuracy on the validation set. Moreover, working and finalizing the documentation using readthedocs and data visualization. We hope to implement further detection methods, and integration of our python codes.

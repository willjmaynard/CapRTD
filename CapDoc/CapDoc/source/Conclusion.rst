Conclusion
==========

In conclusion, we performed the classification and implementation on the training and testing model of the artifact detection tool for blur detection. Currently, achieved results for our current best model which has ~94% accuracy on the training set and ~89% accuracy on the validation set. The accuracy for the Image Variance classifier has an accuracy of ~54% on our validation set. The Laplacian classifier has an accuracy of ~67% on our validation set. This allows us to conclude that the model we created based on the DeepFocus model using a Convoluted Neural Network is more accurate than both the Laplacian and Image Variance models.
